# 🕹️ The Pong – Classic Python Game

This is a Python implementation of the classic **Pong** game using the `turtle` graphics module. It features two paddles, a bouncing ball, and a scoreboard — all built with object-oriented design for modularity and clarity.

## 🚀 Features

- Two-player paddle control (`W/S` for left, `Up/Down` for right)
- Ball movement with realistic bounce physics
- Collision detection with walls and paddles
- Score tracking for both players
- Smooth animation using `screen.tracer(0)` and `time.sleep()`

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `turtle` for graphics and animation
- `time` for frame control
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)


## ▶️ How to Play

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KKostika/Ponk_game
   cd the-pong
2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
3. Controls:
  - Left Paddle: W (up), S (down)
  - Right Paddle: Up Arrow (up), Down Arrow (down)

## 🎯 Objective
Keep the ball in play and score points when your opponent misses. First to reach the target score wins!
